I aim to use this blog to keep a track of the papers I read, sometimes with a link to my implementation/interpretation of the research work done within. I'll try to maintain this blog as frequently as possible, but the blog may not contain a complete repository of research work with which I am up to date.

Current read : [Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00670.pdf)
